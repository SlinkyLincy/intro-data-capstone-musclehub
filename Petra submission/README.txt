Please note that I got married during the course so my surname changed from Hedbavna to Lincoln.

Based on the text in the notebook, I found it difficult to understand the task on sample size
calculation. It says that we are interested in 5 percent point decrease which applies only to Bryce
National Park (decrease from 15% of sheep with the disease to 10%) which gives 33% minimum detectable
effect. However, for Yellowstone National Park, this would be 50% detecable effect. I assumed we
wanted the same detecatble effect of 33% for both parks.
It might be worth clarifying this question for the next cohort.
